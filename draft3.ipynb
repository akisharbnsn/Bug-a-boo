      "What we just walked through is something called AB Testing. We do this when we\n",
      "want to check if a change to our website/product will lead to better “outcomes.”\n",
      "This is where we split a sample of our users into two groups: the control (Group A)\n",
      "and the experimental (Group B). We introduce Group B to a new iteration/version\n",
      "of our website or product, while we keep Group A on the same platform.\n",
      "We then select one specific metric to measure such as click-through rate, amount\n",
      "purchased, amount spent on website, or some other KPI which our\n",
      "managers/stakeholders care about.\n",
      "AB Testing\n",
      "Just like in this previous example, we perform a t-test on these two groups\n",
      "to check if the difference between these groups are statistically significant.\n",
      "However, just like we observed, we don’t want to just state that an update\n",
      "to our product is preferable because the change is significant.\n",

      "beneficial change, is this effect large enough to spend $$$ on rolling\n",
      "out this change?\n",
      "● Have we run this A/B Test multiple times to account for false positives?\n",
      "● Are we just observing the novelty effect?\n",
      "Novelty Effect\n",
      "The novelty effect describes a temporary boost or drop in metrics simply\n",
      "because something is new.\n",
      "People could just be spending more/exploring our website more because:\n",
      "● They are getting used to the new interface (confused)\n",

      "For example, let’s say in order to boost Zoom engagement…\n",

      "might say to yourselves “Woah whats this guys deal? I wonder what else he has\n",
      "up his sleeve.” and we get a massive uptick in Zoom chat participation.\n",
      "I might be tempted to bring this to my managers and state “Look, fun hats\n",
      "boost engagement!” But after the second week, everyone gets bored of the\n",
      "fun hats and Zoom chats drops down to previous levels. TKH’s investment\n",
      "of $45 (4.99 * 9 staff) into the fun-hat fund has just been wasted.\n",
      "Novelty Effect - Patches\n",
      "To offset the novelty effect, we might want to consider:\n",
      "● Run the test for a long-enough time to offset novelty\n",
      "● Segment earlier results to check which results reflect novelty\n",
